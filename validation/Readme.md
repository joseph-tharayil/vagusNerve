# Instructions for validating the semi-analytic approach
1. Download the file SFAPValidation.smash from our osparc project and run the EM and neural simulations
2. Open the file verification_SFAP.py in the Sim4Life scripter and run it. This will output the SFAP calculated using our approach, and using the S4L Neural Sensing Tool, as numpy files
3. Run the notebook SFAP_vs_S4L.ipynb to produce Figure 3 in our paper.
